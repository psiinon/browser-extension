# ZAP Browser Extensions

This repo defines 2 related ZAP browser extensions.

## The 'Full' Extension

A browser extension which allows [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org) to interact directly with the browser.
It also allows you to record whatever you do in a browser as [Zest](https://github.com/zaproxy/zest) scripts.
These can be used to handle complicated authentication flows or sequences of related actions.

Works in both Firefox and Chrome. The Chrome extension also works in Edge but is not currently in the Edge Add-ons Store.

Initially generated from https://github.com/abhijithvijayan/web-extension-starter/tree/react-typescript

Only Firefox, Chrome and Edge have been tested - Opera may or may not work :wink:

This extension is bundled in the ZAP [Client Side Integration](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/client-side-integration/)
add-on, so you typically do not need to install it manually.


The latest published extensions are still available via the relevant stores:

* Firefox [ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/zap-browser-extension/)
* Chrome [ZAP by Checkmarx Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zap-by-checkmarx-browser/cgkggmillbmmpokepnicllalaohphffo)

## The Recorder Extension

This extension only allows you to record [Zest](https://github.com/zaproxy/zest) scripts in the browser.
It will not interact with ZAP, even if you have it running.

You can use this extension to record Zest scripts on a system on which ZAP is not running.
